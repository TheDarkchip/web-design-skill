# Navigation & information architecture (IA)

## Wayfinding
- Users should know: where they are, what’s here, where they can go next.
- Keep navigation labels concrete (Tasks, Billing, Settings).

## Active state
- Current page/section is clearly indicated.
- Breadcrumbs help in deep hierarchies (optional).

## Link vs button
- Links navigate; buttons perform actions.
- Don’t style links as primary buttons unless they truly act as the primary nav action.

## Empty states
- Explain what this area is for.
- Provide next steps: add item, invite teammate, import, etc.
