# Layout & hierarchy (how to make screens readable)

## Information hierarchy checklist
- One clear **primary action** per screen.
- Clear page title; users can answer: “Where am I?” in 2 seconds.
- Group related items; separate groups with whitespace, headings, or containers.
- Reduce competing emphasis: if everything is bold, nothing is.

## Spacing system
- Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g., 4/8/12/16/24/32…).
- Align to a grid; avoid “almost aligned” edges.
- Prefer padding inside components, margin between components.

## Scannability
- Left-align body text; keep line length comfortable (roughly 45–90 chars).
- Use bullets for lists; use bold sparingly for key terms.
- Keep dense tables readable with zebra spacing, sticky headers (if appropriate).

## Visual weight
- Size + contrast + position determine attention.
- Increase primary emphasis by:
  - placing it earlier,
  - increasing whitespace around it,
  - giving it stronger contrast,
  - making alternatives less prominent.

## Common fixes
- “Too cramped” → increase whitespace, reduce font weights, simplify borders, use fewer columns on mobile.
- “No focus” → add a title + one hero region + clear primary CTA.
- “Feels chaotic” → align edges, standardize component heights, unify spacing.
