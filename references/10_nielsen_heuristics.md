# Usability heuristics (Nielsen) — quick reference

Use these to *name* problems so feedback is graspable.

1) **Visibility of system status**
- Users should always know what’s happening (loading, saving, success, error).

2) **Match between system and the real world**
- Use users’ language, natural ordering, familiar concepts.

3) **User control and freedom**
- Undo, cancel, back, escape routes. Don’t trap users in modals/flows.

4) **Consistency and standards**
- Follow platform/web conventions. Don’t make users learn new rules.

5) **Error prevention**
- Constrain inputs, good defaults, confirm destructive actions, inline validation.

6) **Recognition rather than recall**
- Show options; don’t make users remember hidden rules.

7) **Flexibility and efficiency of use**
- Shortcuts for experts, but no barriers for novices.

8) **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
- Remove noise. Every element should earn its visual weight.

9) **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
- Plain-language errors with a fix path; preserve state.

10) **Help and documentation**
- Provide contextual help; don’t dump manuals.
