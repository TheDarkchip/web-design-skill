# Typography (readability-first)

## Defaults that usually work
- Base font size: 16px (or equivalent).
- Use 2–3 text sizes for body UI (e.g., 14/16/18) plus headings.
- Line-height: ~1.4–1.6 for paragraphs; a bit tighter for UI labels.

## Hierarchy
- Use size + weight + spacing to show hierarchy (not just color).
- Headings: consistent scale (e.g., H1/H2/H3).
- Avoid all-caps for long labels; if used, increase letter-spacing slightly.

## Copy in UI
- Buttons: verb-first, specific (“Create account”, not “Submit”).
- Labels: noun phrases (“Email address”).
- Helper text: tells users what good looks like (format, constraints).
- Errors: explain how to fix (“Password must be 12+ characters”).
