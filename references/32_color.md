# Color, states, and visual language

## Color usage
- Use color to support hierarchy, not replace it.
- Reserve high-saturation colors for primary action and critical states.
- Ensure states are distinguishable without relying only on color (add icons/text).

## States checklist
- Buttons/inputs have: default, hover, active/pressed, disabled, focus, loading.
- Links are clearly identifiable; visited state helps navigation on content-heavy sites.

## Containers and depth
- Use subtle boundaries (spacing, background, border) consistently.
- Don’t overuse shadows; they become noise.

## Dark mode (if applicable)
- Don’t just invert; adjust contrast and elevation tokens.
- Maintain focus visibility and readable text.
