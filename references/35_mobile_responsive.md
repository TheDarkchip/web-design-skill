# Mobile & responsive design

## Baseline
- Design for narrow viewports first; scale up.
- Avoid horizontal scroll; prefer stacking.

## Touch
- Targets are comfortably tappable; give breathing room between actions.
- Avoid tiny icon-only buttons without labels or tooltips.

## Layout patterns
- Use a single column with sections.
- Collapsible filters, sticky primary CTA when appropriate.

## Content prioritization
- Move secondary content below primary task area.
- Use progressive disclosure for advanced options.

## Testing checklist
- 320–390px wide viewport pass.
- 200% zoom pass on desktop.
- Keyboard pass (Tab / Shift+Tab / Enter / Space / Esc).
