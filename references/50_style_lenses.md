# Style lenses (optional “vibe” constraints)

Only use a style lens when the user requests a vibe. Otherwise default to web-native neutrality.

## Apple-ish clarity
- Restrained color; strong whitespace and typography hierarchy.
- Crisp alignment; minimal borders; subtle depth.
- Prioritize simplicity and obvious affordances.

## Material-ish
- Clear component states and consistent surfaces.
- Tonal hierarchy (containers) and predictable spacing.
- Strong guidance for components and motion (use motion sparingly).

## Fluent-ish
- Productivity-oriented clarity; readable typography.
- Consistent spacing and layout rhythm.
- Emphasis on content and actions, not decoration.

When applying a lens:
- Keep accessibility and semantics unchanged.
- Don’t introduce “aesthetic-only” changes that reduce clarity.
